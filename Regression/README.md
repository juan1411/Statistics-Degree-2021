# Regression

There were two works that are worth showing.

In the first, we apply the fundamental techniques of simple linear regression to a small dataset.

In the second, we basically applied the same techniques, but the context this time was multiple linear regression.
Thus, we also carried out tests to choose the best model (the best covariates) based on the amount of explained variance.
