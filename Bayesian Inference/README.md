# Bayesian Inference

For the this folder, there are four practical exercises for data analysis and simulation (simple Bayesian techniques), and two tests in report form (they are larger than the exercises and more complete).

For example, in the p1 file a Bayesian modeling is done for age of the oldest companies of the world, starting with the _a priori_ distributions:

Then, the observed distribution of the data is checked:

And finally, the _a posterior_ distributions are analyzed:
