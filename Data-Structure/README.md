# Data-Structure

During the first semester of 2021, I ended up taking the data structure I course at graduation. Well, it was for statisticians, so all the codes were developed in Python ... please, do not laugh.

Anyway, The description of each exercise follows:

- Ex.1: the classic N queens problem.
- Ex.6: implement caesar cipher using two dynamic linked lists, one for the message and other for the cipher key.
- Ex.7: create "undo" and "redo" functions for a simplified game where the player walks through a 3x8 matrix.
- Ex.8: implement a decision tree, basically.
- Ex.9: read a set operations expression, store it in a binary tree, and compute the result.
- Ex.10: "implement a program that: reads all dictionary terms and their respective translations of a file named 'dicio.txt', builds a search binary tree taking into account the alphabetical order of the terms in english, performs queries and tries complete a term if it is not found" as the teacher's assistant said.

Clearly this list is not perfect, I skipped several exercises and this is because we were learning about algorithm analysis too (like O() or $\Omega$() notation), some exercises were about it.
