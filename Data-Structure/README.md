# Data-Structure

During the first semester of 2021, I ended up taking the data structure I course at graduation. Well, it was for statisticians, so all the codes were developed in Python ... please, do not laugh.

Anyway, The description of each exercise follows:

- Ex.1:
- Ex.2:
- Ex.4:
- Ex.5:
- Ex.6:
- Ex.7:
- Ex.8:
- Ex.9:
- Ex.10:

Clearly this list is not perfect, some exercises are missing and this is because we were learning about algorithm analysis too (like O() or $\Omega$() notation), some exercises were about it.
